                <p><strong>Baddi Coach:A Badminton Pose Detection Application</strong></p>
                <p>Developed a pose detection application to improve badminton skills using computer vision techniques. 
                    Incorporated YOLOV8 and PoseNet to analyze player movements and provide real-time feedback on posture and technique. 
                    Implemented keypoint detection to track body parts and identify incorrect postures. 
                    Created a shuttlecock tracking system and a recorded pose detection system for postgame analysis. 
                    Currently in contact with the UC Davis Badminton Team to provide as a client for our further research.</p>

                <p>Utilized machine learning models to predict the malignancy of breast cancer tumors using the Breast Tissue Dataset. 
                    Analyzed parameters such as radius and texture of breast tissue samples to identify key predictive factors using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
                    Implemented algorithms to classify tumors as malignant or benign, and determined the most significant factors contributing to malignancy.</p>
